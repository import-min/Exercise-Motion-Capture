This is an app that watches you lift weights through your phone’s camera and draws the path your barbell takes. After you’re done lifting, it saves the video, with the path included, straight to your phone and even lets you know if your form was solid or all over the place. Just install it, point it at your workout, and let it do the tracking  while you focus on being strong. To run this app, make sure you have Node.js installed (npm comes with it). Then clone the repo, open the folder, run `npm install` to get the dependencies, and start it up with `npx expo start`.
